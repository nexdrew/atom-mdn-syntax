> Atom syntax theme based on MDN code samples

Even though this is a light syntax theme, I think it also works well with dark UI themes. Here's an example paired with the One Dark UI theme:

Created mainly for JavaScript, but supports other languages as well.

## Install

```
$ apm install mdn-syntax
```

Or Settings → Install → Select `Themes` → Search for `mdn-syntax`

## Reference

Note that this is a derivative of the beautiful [Solarized Dark Syntax theme](https://github.com/atom/solarized-dark-syntax), modified to use colors from MDN.

And, of course, the ever-useful MDN docs with plenty of code samples can be found here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web
